# Graphic Design Portfolio Website
Concieved 3 years ago when I didn't yet know the benefits of version control.
Jesus christ do i regret making updates directly on the server after hosting instead of just having it here. 
Anyway I have grown since then, but I wanted to keep this as it was, just hosted here. It was a fun exploration.
